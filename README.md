# Angular Wizard Demo

### Running the seed or final project

* To run the angular demo, [clone this repo](https://github.com/mjosephdelrosario/angular-wizard-demo).

Once you've cloned the repo, install all the dependencies by running:

```bash
yarn install

# OR

npm install
```

You can then dive straight into coding by running:

```bash
yarn start

# OR

npm start
```

This will start up webpack and a local development server at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
